Conditional statements, such as if/else constructs, are used in shell scripting to execute certain blocks of code based on specified conditions. Here are examples of if/else statements in shell scripting:

1. **Basic if/else Statement**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a variable
age=20

# Check if the age is greater than or equal to 18
if [ "$age" -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult."
else
    echo "You are a minor."
fi
```

2. **If/elif/else Statement**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a variable
grade=85

# Check grade level
if [ "$grade" -ge 90 ]; then
    echo "Grade: A"
elif [ "$grade" -ge 80 ]; then
    echo "Grade: B"
elif [ "$grade" -ge 70 ]; then
    echo "Grade: C"
else
    echo "Grade: F"
fi
```

3. **Nested if/else Statement**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
is_weekend="yes"
is_raining="no"

# Check if it's a weekend and raining
if [ "$is_weekend" = "yes" ]; then
    if [ "$is_raining" = "yes" ]; then
        echo "Stay indoors and relax."
    else
        echo "Go out and have fun!"
    fi
else
    echo "It's a weekday, carry on with your activities."
fi
```

4. **Using Logical Operators**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
x=10
y=20

# Check if both conditions are true
if [ "$x" -eq 10 ] && [ "$y" -eq 20 ]; then
    echo "Both conditions are true."
else
    echo "At least one condition is false."
fi
```

5. **Using Test Operators**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define variables
file="example.txt"

# Check if file exists and is readable
if [ -r "$file" ]; then
    echo "File exists and is readable."
else
    echo "File does not exist or is not readable."
fi
```
Certainly! Conditional statements (if/else) are fundamental in shell scripting for making decisions based on certain conditions. Here are additional use cases of conditional statements in shell scripting:

1. **Checking File Existence**:

```bash
# Check if a file exists
file="example.txt"
if [ -e "$file" ]; then
    echo "File $file exists."
else
    echo "File $file does not exist."
fi
```

2. **Checking Directory Existence**:

```bash
# Check if a directory exists
directory="example_dir"
if [ -d "$directory" ]; then
    echo "Directory $directory exists."
else
    echo "Directory $directory does not exist."
fi
```

3. **Checking File Permissions**:

```bash
# Check if a file is writable
file="example.txt"
if [ -w "$file" ]; then
    echo "File $file is writable."
else
    echo "File $file is not writable."
fi
```

4. **Checking Command Exit Status**:

```bash
# Check the exit status of a command
if ls /nonexistent_file; then
    echo "Command executed successfully."
else
    echo "Command failed."
fi
```

5. **Comparing Numeric Values**:

```bash
# Compare two numeric values
value1=10
value2=20
if [ $value1 -lt $value2 ]; then
    echo "$value1 is less than $value2."
else
    echo "$value1 is greater than or equal to $value2."
fi
```

6. **Comparing String Values**:

```bash
# Compare two string values
string1="hello"
string2="world"
if [ "$string1" == "$string2" ]; then
    echo "Strings are equal."
else
    echo "Strings are not equal."
fi
```

7. **Checking Command-Line Arguments**:

```bash
# Check if a command-line argument is provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "No command-line arguments provided."
else
    echo "Command-line arguments provided: $@"
fi
```

8. **Nested if/else Statements**:

```bash
# Nested if/else statements
number=15
if [ $number -lt 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is less than 10."
elif [ $number -eq 10 ]; then
    echo "Number is equal to 10."
else
    echo "Number is greater than 10."
fi
```

9. **Using Logical Operators**:

```bash
# Using logical operators (AND, OR)
age=25
if [ $age -ge 18 ] && [ $age -le 30 ]; then
    echo "Age is between 18 and 30."
else
    echo "Age is not between 18 and 30."
fi
```

These examples demonstrate various use cases of conditional statements (if/else) in shell scripting for making decisions based on conditions. They provide flexibility and control flow in executing commands and scripts based on specific criteria.
